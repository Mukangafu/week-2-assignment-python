# 🐍 Python List Assignment

This project demonstrates basic list operations in Python, such as appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding the index of an item.

## 📌 Task Description

The Python script (`my_script.py`) performs the following steps:

1. Creates an empty list called `my_list`
2. Appends the elements: 10, 20, 30, 40
3. Inserts the value `15` at the second position
4. Extends the list with `[50, 60, 70]`
5. Removes the last element from the list
6. Sorts the list in ascending order
7. Finds and prints the index of the value `30`

## 📂 File Included

- `my_script.py`: The Python script with the list operations
- `README.md`: This documentation file

## ▶️ How to Run
